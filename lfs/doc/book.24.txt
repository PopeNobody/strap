11.1. The End

   Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much success with
   your shiny new custom-built Linux system.

   It may be a good idea to create an /etc/lfs-release file. By having this
   file, it is very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at
   some point) to find out which LFS version is installed on the system.
   Create this file by running:

 echo 11.2 > /etc/lfs-release

   Two files describing the installed system may be used by packages that can
   be installed on the system later, either in binary form or by building
   them.

   The first one shows the status of your new system with respect to the
   Linux Standards Base (LSB). To create this file, run:

 cat > /etc/lsb-release << "EOF"
 DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
 DISTRIB_RELEASE="11.2"
 DISTRIB_CODENAME="<your name here>"
 DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
 EOF

   The second one contains roughly the same information, and is used by
   systemd and some graphical desktop environments. To create this file, run:

 cat > /etc/os-release << "EOF"
 NAME="Linux From Scratch"
 VERSION="11.2"
 ID=lfs
 PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch 11.2"
 VERSION_CODENAME="<your name here>"
 EOF

   Be sure to put some sort of customization for the fields
   'DISTRIB_CODENAME' and 'VERSION_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely
   yours.

11.2. Get Counted

   Now that you have finished the book, do you want to be counted as an LFS
   user? Head over to https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/cgi-bin/lfscounter.php
   and register as an LFS user by entering your name and the first LFS
   version you have used.

   Let's reboot into LFS now.

11.3. Rebooting the System

   Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot your
   computer. However, you should be aware of a few things. The system you
   have created in this book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have
   the functionality you would need to be able to continue forward. By
   installing a few extra packages from the BLFS book while still in our
   current chroot environment, you can leave yourself in a much better
   position to continue on once you reboot into your new LFS installation.
   Here are some suggestions:

     * A text mode browser such as Lynx will allow you to easily view the
       BLFS book in one virtual terminal, while building packages in another.

     * The make-ca package will allow you to set up local trusted anchor
       certificates, allowing the system to verify SSL certificates provided
       by remote servers (for example, a website using HTTPS).

     * The GPM package will allow you to perform copy/paste actions in your
       virtual terminals.

     * If you are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet
       your networking requirements, installing a package such as dhcpcd or
       the client portion of dhcp may be useful.

     * Installing sudo may be useful for building packages as a non-root user
       and easily installing the resulting packages in your new system.

     * If you want to access your new system from a remote system within a
       comfortable GUI environment, install openssh.

     * To make fetching files over the internet easier, install wget.

     * To connect to a wireless access point for networking, install
       wpa_supplicant.

     * Install firmwares if the kernel driver for your hardware require some
       firmware to function properly.

     * Finally, a review of the following configuration files is also
       appropriate at this point.

          * /etc/bashrc

          * /etc/dircolors

          * /etc/fstab

          * /etc/hosts

          * /etc/inputrc

          * /etc/profile

          * /etc/resolv.conf

          * /etc/vimrc

          * /root/.bash_profile

          * /root/.bashrc

          * /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0

   Now that we have said that, let's move on to booting our shiny new LFS
   installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment:

 logout

   Then unmount the virtual file systems:

 umount -v $LFS/dev/pts
 umount -v $LFS/dev
 umount -v $LFS/run
 umount -v $LFS/proc
 umount -v $LFS/sys

   If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other partitions before
   unmounting the main one, like this:

 umount -v $LFS/usr
 umount -v $LFS/home
 umount -v $LFS

   Unmount the LFS file system itself:

 umount -v $LFS

   Now, reboot the system with:

 shutdown -r now

   Assuming the GRUB boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu is
   set to boot LFS 11.2 automatically.

   When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and more
   software may be added to suit your needs.

11.4. What Now?

   Thank you for reading this LFS book. We hope that you have found this book
   helpful and have learned more about the system creation process.

   Now that the LFS system is installed, you may be wondering “What next?” To
   answer that question, we have compiled a list of resources for you.

     * Maintenance

       Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all software.
       Since an LFS system is compiled from source, it is up to you to keep
       abreast of such reports. There are several online resources that track
       such reports, some of which are shown below:

          * CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team)

            CERT has a mailing list that publishes security alerts concerning
            various operating systems and applications. Subscription
            information is available at
            http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/signup.html.

          * Bugtraq

            Bugtraq is a full-disclosure computer security mailing list. It
            publishes newly discovered security issues, and occasionally
            potential fixes for them. Subscription information is available
            at http://www.securityfocus.com/archive.

     * Beyond Linux From Scratch

       The Beyond Linux From Scratch book covers installation procedures for
       a wide range of software beyond the scope of the LFS Book. The BLFS
       project is located at
       https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.2/.

     * LFS Hints

       The LFS Hints are a collection of educational documents submitted by
       volunteers in the LFS community. The hints are available at
       https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/.

     * Mailing lists

       There are several LFS mailing lists you may subscribe to if you are in
       need of help, want to stay current with the latest developments, want
       to contribute to the project, and more. See Chapter 1 - Mailing Lists
       for more information.

     * The Linux Documentation Project

       The goal of The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP) is to collaborate
       on all of the issues of Linux documentation. The TLDP features a large
       collection of HOWTOs, guides, and man pages. It is located at
       http://www.tldp.org/.
