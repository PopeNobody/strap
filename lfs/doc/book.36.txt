   CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
   SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
   RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS"
   BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION

   License

   THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
   COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
   COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
   AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

   BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
   TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
   RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
   AND CONDITIONS.

    1. Definitions

         1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
            anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
            unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
            constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
            assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
            Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
            defined below) for the purposes of this License.

         2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
            Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
            arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
            version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
            condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
            transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
            Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
            purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
            Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
            synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
            ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
            of this License.

         3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
            under the terms of this License.

         4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
            Work.

         5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
            the terms of this License.

         6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
            License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
            with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
            from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
            previous violation.

         7. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
            attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
            this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

    2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
       or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
       limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
       copyright law or other applicable laws.

    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
       Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
       exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

         1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
            Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in
            the Collective Works;

         2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

         3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
            perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
            audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
            Collective Works;

         4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
            perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
            audio transmission Derivative Works;

       The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
       known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
       such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
       in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
       Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights
       set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

    4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
       subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

         1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
            License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
            Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
            the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
            on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
            the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
            not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
            refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
            may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
            measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
            inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
            applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
            this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work
            itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
            create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
            to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
            reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
            If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor
            You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative
            Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
            requested.

         2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
            of this License, a later version of this License with the same
            License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
            license that contains the same License Elements as this License
            (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must
            include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
            License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
            every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
            publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
            perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
            Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
            recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You
            must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
            the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
            display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
            Derivative Work with any technological measures that control
            access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
            of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative
            Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
            require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
            to be made subject to the terms of this License.

         3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section
            3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
            toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
            exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
            digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
            intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
            monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
            monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
            copyrighted works.

         4. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
            Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
            the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
            medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
            pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
            title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
            practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
            Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
            URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
            information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
            credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
            (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
            "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
            credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
            however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
            Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
            comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
            prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

         5. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
            composition:

              1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
                 reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
                 individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
                 ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or
                 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if
                 that performance is primarily intended for or directed
                 toward commercial advantage or private monetary
                 compensation.

              2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves
                 the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via
                 a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
                 Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
                 Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
                 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
                 Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if
                 Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
                 intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
                 private monetary compensation. 6. Webcasting Rights and
                 Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
                 Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
                 right to collect, whether individually or via a
                 performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties
                 for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
                 Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
                 Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
                 other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is
                 primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
                 advantage or private monetary compensation.

         6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
            doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the
            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
            the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
            subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
            of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
            jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
            intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
            monetary compensation.

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

       UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
       LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
       WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
       STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
       TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
       NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
       OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
       SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
       SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
       LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
       FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
       DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
       LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. Termination

         1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
            automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
            License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
            Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
            will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
            or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
            Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
            this License.

         2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
            here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
            in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
            right to release the Work under different license terms or to
            stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
            any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
            other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
            the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
            full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

    8. Miscellaneous

         1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
            or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
            license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
            license granted to You under this License.

         2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
            Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
            the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
            granted to You under this License.

         3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
            under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
            enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
            without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
            make such provision valid and enforceable.

         4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
            no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
            writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
            consent.

         5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
            with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
            understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
            Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
            additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
            You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
            agreement of the Licensor and You.
