1.1. How to Build an LFS System

   The LFS system will be built by using an already installed Linux
   distribution (such as Debian, OpenMandriva, Fedora, or openSUSE). This
   existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting point to
   provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and shell, to
   build the new system. Select the “development” option during the
   distribution installation to be able to access these tools.

   As an alternative to installing a separate distribution onto your machine,
   you may wish to use a LiveCD from a commercial distribution.

   Chapter 2 of this book describes how to create a new Linux native
   partition and file system. This is the place where the new LFS system will
   be compiled and installed. Chapter 3 explains which packages and patches
   need to be downloaded to build an LFS system and how to store them on the
   new file system. Chapter 4 discusses the setup of an appropriate working
   environment. Please read Chapter 4 carefully as it explains several
   important issues you need be aware of before beginning to work your way
   through Chapter 5 and beyond.

   Chapter 5, explains the installation of the initial tool chain, (binutils,
   gcc, and glibc) using cross compilation techniques to isolate the new
   tools from the host system.

   Chapter 6 shows you how to cross-compile basic utilities using the just
   built cross-toolchain.

   Chapter 7 then enters a "chroot" environment and uses the previously built
   tools to build the additional tools needed to build and test the final
   system.

   This effort to isolate the new system from the host distribution may seem
   excessive. A full technical explanation as to why this is done is provided
   in Toolchain Technical Notes.

   In Chapter 8, The full LFS system is built. Another advantage provided by
   the chroot environment is that it allows you to continue using the host
   system while LFS is being built. While waiting for package compilations to
   complete, you can continue using your computer as normal.

   To finish the installation, the basic system configuration is set up in
   Chapter 9, and the kernel and boot loader are set up in Chapter 10.
   Chapter 11 contains information on continuing the LFS experience beyond
   this book. After the steps in this book have been implemented, the
   computer will be ready to reboot into the new LFS system.

   This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each step is
   discussed in the following chapters and package descriptions. Items that
   may seem complicated will be clarified, and everything will fall into
   place as you embark on the LFS adventure.

1.4. Resources

  1.4.1. FAQ

   If during the building of the LFS system you encounter any errors, have
   any questions, or think there is a typo in the book, please start by
   consulting the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that is located at
   https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/.

  1.4.2. Mailing Lists

   The linuxfromscratch.org server hosts a number of mailing lists used for
   the development of the LFS project. These lists include the main
   development and support lists, among others. If the FAQ does not solve the
   problem you are having, the next step would be to search the mailing lists
   at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html.

   For information on the different lists, how to subscribe, archive
   locations, and additional information, visit
   https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mail.html.

  1.4.3. IRC

   Several members of the LFS community offer assistance on Internet Relay
   Chat (IRC). Before using this support, please make sure that your question
   is not already answered in the LFS FAQ or the mailing list archives. You
   can find the IRC network at irc.libera.chat. The support channel is named
   #lfs-support.

  1.4.4. Mirror Sites

   The LFS project has a number of world-wide mirrors to make accessing the
   website and downloading the required packages more convenient. Please
   visit the LFS website at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html for
   a list of current mirrors.

  1.4.5. Contact Information

   Please direct all your questions and comments to one of the LFS mailing
   lists (see above).

1.5. Help

   If an issue or a question is encountered while working through this book,
   please check the FAQ page at
   https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#generalfaq. Questions are often
   already answered there. If your question is not answered on this page, try
   to find the source of the problem. The following hint will give you some
   guidance for troubleshooting:
   https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/errors.txt.

   If you cannot find your problem listed in the FAQ, search the mailing
   lists at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html.

   We also have a wonderful LFS community that is willing to offer assistance
   through the mailing lists and IRC (see the Section 1.4, “Resources”
   section of this book). However, we get several support questions every day
   and many of them can be easily answered by going to the FAQ and by
   searching the mailing lists first. So, for us to offer the best assistance
   possible, you need to do some research on your own first. That allows us
   to focus on the more unusual support needs. If your searches do not
   produce a solution, please include all relevant information (mentioned
   below) in your request for help.

  1.5.1. Things to Mention

   Apart from a brief explanation of the problem being experienced, the
   essential things to include in any request for help are:

     * The version of the book being used (in this case 11.2)

     * The host distribution and version being used to create LFS

     * The output from the Host System Requirements script

     * The package or section the problem was encountered in

     * The exact error message or symptom being received

     * Note whether you have deviated from the book at all

  Note

   Deviating from this book does not mean that we will not help you. After
   all, LFS is about personal preference. Being upfront about any changes to
   the established procedure helps us evaluate and determine possible causes
   of your problem.

  1.5.2. Configure Script Problems

   If something goes wrong while running the configure script, review the
   config.log file. This file may contain errors encountered during configure
   which were not printed to the screen. Include the relevant lines if you
   need to ask for help.

  1.5.3. Compilation Problems

   Both the screen output and the contents of various files are useful in
   determining the cause of compilation problems. The screen output from the
   configure script and the make run can be helpful. It is not necessary to
   include the entire output, but do include enough of the relevant
   information. Below is an example of the type of information to include
   from the screen output from make:

 gcc -DALIASPATH=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale:.\"
 -DLOCALEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale\"
 -DLIBDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/lib\"
 -DINCLUDEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/include\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.
 -g -O2 -c getopt1.c
 gcc -g -O2 -static -o make ar.o arscan.o commands.o dir.o
 expand.o file.o function.o getopt.o implicit.o job.o main.o
 misc.o read.o remake.o rule.o signame.o variable.o vpath.o
 default.o remote-stub.o version.o opt1.o
 -lutil job.o: In function `load_too_high':
 /lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1/job.c:1565: undefined reference
 to `getloadavg'
 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
 make[2]: *** [make] Error 1
 make[2]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
 make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
 make[1]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
 make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

   In this case, many people would just include the bottom section:

 make [2]: *** [make] Error 1

   This is not enough information to properly diagnose the problem because it
   only notes that something went wrong, not what went wrong. The entire
   section, as in the example above, is what should be saved because it
   includes the command that was executed and the associated error
   message(s).

   An excellent article about asking for help on the Internet is available
   online at http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. Read and follow
   the hints in this document to increase the likelihood of getting the help
   you need.
